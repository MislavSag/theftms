Tools for Handling Extraction of Features from Time series (theft)

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
comment = NA, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8, cache = FALSE)
```

## Installation

*Coming to CRAN soon... Stay posted!*

You can install the development version of `theft` from GitHub using the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/theft")
```

## General purpose

`theft` is a software package for R that facilitates user-friendly access to a structured analytical pipeline for the computation, analysis, and visualisation of time-series features. The package pulls and concatenates a large number of time-series feature statistic methods from a range of existing R packages and lets the user specify which groups (or all) of the these features to calculate. The packages which `theft` currently steals features from include:

* [Rcatch22](https://github.com/hendersontrent/Rcatch22)
* [feasts](https://feasts.tidyverts.org)
* [tsfeatures](https://github.com/robjhyndman/tsfeatures)
* [Kats](https://facebookresearch.github.io/Kats/)
* [tsfresh](https://tsfresh.com)
* [TSFEL](https://tsfel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Note that `Kats`, `tsfresh` and `tsfel` are Python packages. The R package `reticulate` is used to call Python code that uses these packages and applies it within the broader *tidy* data philosophy embodied by `theft`. At present, depending on the input time-series, `theft` provides access to ~1000 features. Prior to using `theft` (only if you want to use the `Kats`, `tsfresh` or `tsfel` feature sets - the R-based sets will run fine) you should have a working Python installation and download `Kats` using the instructions located [here](https://facebookresearch.github.io/Kats/), `tsfresh` [here](https://tsfresh.com) or `tsfel` [here](https://github.com/fraunhoferportugal/tsfel).

## Statistical and graphical tools

The package also contains a suite of tools for automatic normalisation of extracted feature vectors, low dimensional projections, class discrimination visualisations, and data matrix visualisations.

## Web application

An [interactive web application](https://dynamicsandneuralsystems.shinyapps.io/timeseriesfeaturevis/) has been built on top of `theft` which enables users to access all of the functionality included in the package from within a web browser without any code. The application automates the entire workflow included in `theft`, converts all static graphics included in the package into interactive visualisations, and enables downloads of feature calculations.
