Tools for Handling Exploratory Features from Time-series (theft)

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
comment = NA, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8, cache = FALSE)
```

## Installation

*Coming to CRAN soon... Stay posted!*

You can install the development version of `theft` from GitHub using the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/theft")
```

## General purpose

`theft` is a software package for R that facilitates user-friendly access to a structured analytical pipeline for the computation, analysis, and visualisation of time-series features. The package pulls and concatenates a large number of time-series feature statistic methods from a range of existing R packages and lets the user specify which groups (or all) of the these features to calculate. The packages which `theft` currently pulls together include:

* [catch22](https://github.com/hendersontrent/catch22)
* [feasts](https://feasts.tidyverts.org)
* [tsfeatures](https://github.com/robjhyndman/tsfeatures)

The package also contains a suite of tools for automatic normalisation of extracted feature vectors, dimension reduction, and data visualisation. The entire package is developed around principles of [tidy data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html), meaning it integrates with and uses existing [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) and [tidyverts](https://tidyverts.org) software.
