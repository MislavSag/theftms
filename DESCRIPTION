Description: Consolidates and calculates sets of CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics (catch) and other 
    statistical features from existing R packages, and uses them in a high-level API user-friendly
    way to produce inferential or out-of-sample statistical and machine learning models to 
    classify time-series data. Provides a simple functional API to standardise and automate 
    the entire analytical workflow from feature calculation to normalisation to modelling to 
    data visualisation and diagnostics.
