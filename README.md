Tools for Handling Extraction of Features from Time series (theft)

## Installation

*Coming to CRAN soonâ€¦ Stay posted\!*

You can install the development version of `theft` from GitHub using the
following:

``` r
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/theft")
```

## General purpose

`theft` is a software package for R that facilitates user-friendly
access to a structured analytical pipeline for the computation,
analysis, and visualisation of time-series features. The package pulls
and concatenates a large number of time-series feature statistic methods
from a range of existing R packages and lets the user specify which
groups (or all) of the these features to calculate. The packages which
`theft` currently steals features from include:

  - [Rcatch22](https://github.com/hendersontrent/Rcatch22)
  - [feasts](https://feasts.tidyverts.org)
  - [tsfeatures](https://github.com/robjhyndman/tsfeatures)
  - [tsfresh](https://tsfresh.com)
  - [TSFEL](https://tsfel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Note that `tsfresh` and `tsfel` are Python packages. The R package
`reticulate` is used to call Python code that uses `tsfresh` and applies
it within the broader *tidy* data philosophy embodied by `theft`. At
present, depending on the input time-series, `theft` provides access to
\~1200 features. Prior to using `theft` (only if you want to use the
`tsfresh` or `tsfel` feature sets - the R-based sets will run fine) you
should have a working Python installation and download `tsfresh` using
the instructions located [here](https://tsfresh.com) and `tsfel`
[here](https://github.com/fraunhoferportugal/tsfel).

## Statistical tools

The package also contains a suite of tools for automatic normalisation
of extracted feature vectors, dimension reduction and low dimension
visualisation, and other statistical graphics. The entire package is
developed around principles of [tidy
data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html),
meaning it integrates with and uses existing
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) and
[tidyverts](https://tidyverts.org) software.

## Web application

An [interactive web
application](https://dynamicsandneuralsystems.shinyapps.io/timeseriesfeaturevis/)
has been built on top of `theft` which enables users to access all of
the functionality included in the package from within a web browser
without any code. The application automates the entire workflow included
in `theft`, converts all static graphics included in the package into
interactive visualisations, and enables downloads of feature
calculations.
