\title{Helper function to remove duplicate features that exist in multiple feature sets}
\usage{
filter_duplicates(data, preference = c("feasts", "tsfeatures", "Kats"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{feature_calculations} object containing the raw feature matrix produced by \code{calculate_features}}

\item{preference}{\code{character} denoting which feature set to keep (meaning the others will be filtered out) between \code{"feasts"}, \code{"tsfeatures"}, and \code{"Kats"} since there is considerable overlap between these three sets. Defaults to \code{"feasts"}. Only applies if \code{by_set = TRUE} (since a set of "All features" is constructed automatically as a comparator)}
}
\value{
\code{feature_calculations} object containing filtered feature data
